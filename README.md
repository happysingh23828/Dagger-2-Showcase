# Dagger-2-Showcase
This project implements the dagger 2 for dependency injection

### This repository containes three branches.
 - [without_dependency_injection](https://github.com/happysingh23828/Dagger-2-Showcase/tree/without_dependency_injection)
 - [manual_dependency_injection](https://github.com/happysingh23828/Dagger-2-Showcase/tree/manual_dependency_injection)
 - [dagger_dependency_injection](https://github.com/happysingh23828/Dagger-2-Showcase/tree/dagger_dependency_injection)

In this repo I have taken an exmaple of [Car](https://github.com/happysingh23828/Dagger-2-Showcase/blob/dagger_dependency_injection/app/src/main/java/com/androchef/dagger2showcase/car_factory/Car.kt).
We need to drive the car. so for driving the car we need dependencies like 
- [Engine](https://github.com/happysingh23828/Dagger-2-Showcase/blob/dagger_dependency_injection/app/src/main/java/com/androchef/dagger2showcase/car_factory/engines/DieselEngine.kt)
- [Rimes](https://github.com/happysingh23828/Dagger-2-Showcase/blob/dagger_dependency_injection/app/src/main/java/com/androchef/dagger2showcase/car_factory/wheels/Rims.kt)
- [Tires](https://github.com/happysingh23828/Dagger-2-Showcase/blob/dagger_dependency_injection/app/src/main/java/com/androchef/dagger2showcase/car_factory/wheels/Tires.kt)
- [Wheels](https://github.com/happysingh23828/Dagger-2-Showcase/blob/dagger_dependency_injection/app/src/main/java/com/androchef/dagger2showcase/car_factory/wheels/Wheels.kt)
- [Remote](https://github.com/happysingh23828/Dagger-2-Showcase/blob/dagger_dependency_injection/app/src/main/java/com/androchef/dagger2showcase/car_factory/extra/Remote.kt)
- [Driver](https://github.com/happysingh23828/Dagger-2-Showcase/blob/dagger_dependency_injection/app/src/main/java/com/androchef/dagger2showcase/car_factory/drivers/Driver.kt)

These 3 branches tells how can these dependecies are provided to Car Class.
